## **EMBARGO**
The data used to make this analysis is under Embargo. Only the methods used will be shared in this repository.

## Background
Today, is it still unclear if having a systemic morphological right ventricle has a worse impact on the cardiorespiratory fitness of an individual as to have a disease impairing the function of a systemic morphological left ventricle. To change from the usual paradigm of looking at specific markers without knowing the real impact on the cardiorespiratory fitness of patients, principal components analysis was chosen. The unsupervised machine learning technique will allow us to explore from a different angle the relationships between clinical markers and the type of morphological ventricle in systemic position.

## Methods
A total of 25 patients with a systemic morphological right ventricle were match to 25 patients with a systemic morphological left ventricle. Exact matching was used for sex and NYHA (i.e. respiratory empairment; 1 = no impairment, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate and 4 = severe) classification. Coarse exact matching was used for age, BMI, Diuritics doses and ejection fraction of the respective systemic ventricle. Principal components analysis was done with python (*version* 3.10.6) and sklearn packages (*version* 0.24.1).

## Results

### Figure 1 - *Difference between patients with a systemic right ventricle and a systemic left ventricle*
> Because data is under embargo, principal(s) component(s) (PC) will not be disclose. *PC1*, explained 18% of variance; *PC2*, explained 16% of vairance; *PC3* explained 10% of variance. Group 0 (ðŸ”´) - systemic right ventricle; group 1 (ðŸ”µ) - systemic left ventricle.
